# What is WindowsToGo?
WindowsToGo is a USB that is able to boot a full Windows Installation, Typically created by Windows Application , Rufus, this drive can enable you to boot with your own user on any Windows Computer.
# Installation
## Test No. 1 (Failed)
Creating the drive can not be created using a typical installation media as it is regarded as an external drive even after formatting it to NTFS and GPT. This Was tested using a Windows 11 Installation Media and was not Successful

## Test No. 2 (Succeeded)
Rufus has a built in feature to create a WinToGo USB which takes around twenty minutes and also create a Local User with mo Password, This Works very well as Windows 11 requires a microsoft account during setup

## Test No. 3 (Succeeded)
A program named WinToUSB made by a company called Hasleo works fine for begginers but requires for you to setup the whole PC yourself and a Microsoft account, not to mention you can only use a Home license unless you pay Â£30, Whereas it does have its good as you can convert your drive to a HDD or enable BitLocker
# Booting
Booting into the OS for the first time takes a while as it installs Drivers. Do NOT turn your PC off during this progress. Rufus installation comes with no password but requires you to change it during first boot.

# MacOS Boot
Booting with the drive with Macintosh Computers are a bit more complex, it requires different drivers. THIS ONLY WORKS WITH INTEL MACS.
## Downloading the Drivers
The Drivers are able to download here, https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1837?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US

## Installing the Drivers
